# Introduction  

NYC (New Amsterdam) was founded on a land deal and from then on has been driven by profit and commerce. NYC has since weathered many booms and busts. It is with this I endeavor to analyze the impact on businesses of recessions in the United States. My father is a small business owner and I have friends who have started businesses in NYC. I would like to understand potentially how long a recession would impact the NYC economic climate as I have been here in this city since birth.

The data sources I would use are:

1. The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) web site on U.S Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions: https://www.nber.org/cycles/. Though I had initially decided to use Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States as a source for dates of recessions, NBER's site proved to be a more reliable source. A copy of the web page was downloaded on May 6, 2020 and is available here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logicalschema/DATA607/master/FinalProject/nber.html

2. NYC Open Data: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Business/Legally-Operating-Businesses/w7w3-xahh  as a source for data from at least 1998 for licenses of businesses in NYC. The data contains the types of industry and information about their licenses. A download of the data was made to csv and is available here: https://github.com/logicalschema/DATA607/raw/master/FinalProject/Legally_Operating_Businesses.csv.gz 

Based on the data, I would like to see how long NYC would potentially be impacted by financial downturn. 

Let's start by using the libraries we will be using.

```{r, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(xml2)
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)
library(rvest)
library(lubridate)
library(tidyverse)
library(summarytools)
library(ggplot2)
library(leaflet)

# For summarytools package
opts_chunk$set(results = 'asis',      
                comment = NA,
                prompt  = FALSE,
                cache   = FALSE)

st_options(plain.ascii = FALSE,        
            style        = "rmarkdown", 
            footnote     = NA,          
            subtitle.emphasis = FALSE)  


# Function to remove HTML tags from x
cleanHTML <- function(x) {
  return(gsub("<.*?>", "", x))
}


```

<div style="margin-bottom:50px;"></div>
# Import {.tabset}
This section will go over how the data was imported for use in R. 


<div style="margin-bottom:50px;"></div>
## NYC Zip Codes  

![](https://github.com/logicalschema/DATA607/raw/master/FinalProject/boroughs.jpg)

NYC consists of five boroughs: the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan (aka New York), Queens, and Staten Island. Queens can be broken down into its old village system where cities are listed as such villages as Jackson Heights, Elmhurst, and Forest Hills. I decided that I needed a one-to-one mapping of zip code to borough to better represent the data. For this, I consulted the web site: https://www.nycbynatives.com/nyc_info/new_york_city_zip_codes.php that breaks down zip codes into the associated borough. This page was downloaded and saved on my Github. 

```{r, results="markdown"}
zipHTML <- read_html("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logicalschema/DATA607/master/FinalProject/neighborhoods.html")
tbls <- html_nodes(zipHTML, "table")
zip <- as.data.frame(html_table(tbls))
zip <- zip[, -c(3)]
zipcode <- zip$X1
zipcode <- c(zipcode, zip$X4)
borough <- zip$X2
borough <- c(borough, zip$X5)
zipcodes <- cbind(zipcode, borough)
zipcodes <- as.data.frame(zipcodes)
zipcodes <- distinct(zipcodes, zipcode, .keep_all = TRUE)
zipcodes$borough <- str_replace(zipcodes$borough, 'Staten', 'Staten Island')

# zipcodes dataframe matches zip codes with the appropriate borough
zipcodes


```

The dataframe `zipcodes` has a mapping of zip codes to their corresponding borough. This will be used for the import of te NYC OpenData to map valid zip codes with their corresponding borough.

Here is map view of NYC using the `leaflet` library.
```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=10}
# https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/
# https://maps.nyc.gov/tiles/leaflet-xyz.html
# https://rpubs.com/jhofman/nycmaps

m <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  
  addMarkers(lng=-73.989850, lat=40.748590, popup="<b>CUNY School of Professional Studies</b><br>119 W 31st Street<br>New York, NY 10001") %>% 
  setView(lng = -73.98925, lat = 40.75039, zoom = 11)
m  # Print the map
```


<div style="margin-bottom:50px;"></div>
## NYC Data  

The NYC OpenData Platform allows you to download their data in xml and csv formats. It is a very handy source. The csv was downloaded and I placed it on my Github.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Using read_csv as it allows for on the fly decompression of zip csv files
# licenseData <- read_csv("https://github.com/logicalschema/DATA607/raw/master/FinalProject/Legally_Operating_Businesses.csv.gz")

# Reading the Legally_Operating_Businesses.csv file
licenseData <- read.csv("Legally_Operating_Businesses.csv", 
                    sep = ",", 
                    header = TRUE)


# A view of what was imported
head(licenseData, 10)

```

The imported table `licenseData` has these as columns: `r names(licenseData)`

I will tidy up the data and take a subset of the information I need. In the end of this section, I will use the data from `zipcodes` to populate a new column `Address.Borough` that will have the corresponding borough of the business address. For invalid zip codes, it will have `NA`.

```{r}

# Remove unnecessary columns from the imported data 
data <- subset(licenseData, select = -c(Contact.Phone.Number, 
                                        Address.Borough, 
                                        Borough.Code, 
                                        Community.Board, 
                                        Council.District, 
                                        BIN, 
                                        BBL, 
                                        NTA, 
                                        Census.Tract, 
                                        Detail, 
                                        Longitude, 
                                        Latitude, 
                                        Location)
               )

# Convert License.Creation.Date and License.Expiration.Date to Date types
data$License.Expiration.Date <- as.Date(data$License.Expiration.Date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
data$License.Creation.Date <- as.Date(data$License.Creation.Date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")

# Reorder the columns
data <- data[c(6,4,5,3,2,1,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14)]

# Order the rows by the License Creation.Date
data <- data[order(data$License.Creation.Date),]


# Zip codes to Boroughs
tempzips <- data$Address.ZIP


for (value in zipcodes$zipcode){
    tempborough <-  zipcodes %>% filter(zipcode == value) %>% select(borough)
    tempzips <- str_replace_all(tempzips, as.character(value), as.character(tempborough))
}

# Set NA to any zip codes that are not found in NYC
tempzips[!(tempzips %in% c("Bronx","Brooklyn", "Manhattan", "Queens", "Staten Island"))] <- NA

# Add the boroughs as Address.Borough to the NYC data
data <- cbind(data, "Address.Borough" = tempzips)

# A view of the data
head(data, 10)


# Remove before finalizing project
write.csv(data,"data.csv", row.names = FALSE)


```

We have the recession and NYC's data. We are ready to begin analysis.

## NBER

I used `rvest` to obtain the information from NBER's page. I was mainly interested in the recession data. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logicalschema/DATA607/master/FinalProject/nber.png)

As mentioned before, the page was downloaded and stored in my Github account. NBER did not make a clean HTML table to represent their data. The peaks and troughs of expansions and contractions are represented as individual `<td>` elements in one row instead of multiple rows. I am defining a recession period as a peak to its corresponding trough using the NBER data. Some text wrangling is needed for our data.


```{r, warning=FALSE}
nberHTML <- read_html("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logicalschema/DATA607/master/FinalProject/nber.html")

# Grab the td HTML nodes that have the nowrap attribute
tableData <- nberHTML %>%  html_nodes("td[nowrap]")

# We only need the first two elements representing the peaks and troughs of recessions
tableData <- head(tableData, 2) %>% str_replace_all("[\n]" , "")
tableData

```

The above gives us the elements for peaks and trough. Each row is denoted by a line break and will need some cleaning before importing into a dataframe.  
<br>

```{r, warning=FALSE}

peaks <- head(tableData, 1) 
peaks <- peaks %>% str_split("<br>")
peaks <- cleanHTML(peaks)
peaks <- data.frame(peak=unlist(strsplit(as.character(peaks),",")))

troughs <- tail(tableData, 1) 
troughs <- troughs %>% str_split("<br>")
troughs <- cleanHTML(troughs)
troughs <- data.frame(trough=unlist(strsplit(as.character(troughs),",")))

# Combine the peaks and troughs
resessionData <- cbind(peaks, troughs)

# Remove (I... IV) and trailing space
resessionData$peak <- str_replace(resessionData$peak, "\\(.*\\)", "")
resessionData$peak <- str_replace_all(resessionData$peak, '\"', '')

resessionData$trough <- str_replace(resessionData$trough, "\\(.*\\)", "")
resessionData$trough <- str_replace_all(resessionData$trough, '\"', '')

# Replace multiple spaces with one space 
resessionData$peak <- str_replace_all(resessionData$peak, '([ ]+)', ' ')
resessionData$trough <- str_replace_all(resessionData$trough, '([ ]+)', ' ')

# Remove leading and trailing whitespace
resessionData$peak <- str_trim(resessionData$peak)
resessionData$trough <- str_trim(resessionData$trough)


#Remove the first and last rows as they were irrelevant 
resessionData <- resessionData[-1, ]
resessionData <- head(resessionData, -1)

# Creating a new column where the peaks and troughs are converted to Date variables
start <-  as.Date(paste(resessionData$peak, "1", sep = " "), format = "%B %Y %d")
end <- as.Date(paste(resessionData$trough, "1", sep = " "), format = "%B %Y %d")
resessionData <- cbind(resessionData, start = start, end = end)

```

Here is a look at the NBER data tidied up.

```{r}
resessionData

```


<div style="margin-bottom:50px;"></div> 

# Analysis {.tabset}
In this section we will look through to see what insights we can gleam from our NYC license data.


This is a view of the frequency for the `Industry` variable of the license data.

```{r}
freq(data$Industry, order = "freq", plain.ascii = FALSE)
```

Here is a summary of the data.

```{r, results="markup"}
summary(data)
```

<div style="margin-bottom:50px;"></div>

<div style="overflow: scroll;">
Here is an additional summary of the license data. Note the earliest license creation date for this data is January 24, 1977 and the latest is April 24, 2020.

```{r}
print(dfSummary(data[, c(1:5)], graph.magnif = 0.75), method = 'render')

```
</div>


# Visuals {.tabset}



## New Licenses Created by Year

The following graph is the frequency of licenses created by year. 

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=11}


# Histogram of licenses created by year
freq <- data %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(format(License.Creation.Date, '%Y'))) %>%
  group_by(year) %>% 
  tally()

# Basic barplot
p <- ggplot(data=freq, aes(x=year, y=n)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="steelblue") +
  labs(title = "Frequency of Licenses by Year") + 
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Count")
p



```



## Bar Graph by Industry

The following graph is the licenses created for industries.

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=11}

theme_set(theme_classic())

# Histogram on a Categorical variable
g <- ggplot(data, aes(Industry)) + coord_flip()
g + geom_bar(aes(fill=Address.Borough), width = 0.5) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=65, vjust=0.6)) + 
  labs(title="Histogram on Industry", 
       subtitle="Industry across NYC Borough") 
```




## Circular Bargraph 

The following graph depicts the frequency of licenses by industry for each of the 5 boroughs.

```{r, fig.width=10,fig.height=11}

# https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/295-basic-circular-barplot.html was used to assist in making the circular histogram
data1 <- data.frame(
  id=seq(1,59),
  value=sample( seq(10,100), 59, replace=T)
)

data1 <- cbind(data1, "individual" = unique(data$Industry))

# ----- This section prepare a dataframe for labels ---- #
# Get the name and the y position of each label
label_data <- data1
 
# calculate the ANGLE of the labels
number_of_bar <- nrow(label_data)
angle <-  90 - 360 * (label_data$id-0.5) / number_of_bar     

# calculate the alignment of labels: right or left
# If I am on the left part of the plot, my labels have currently an angle < -90
label_data$hjust<-ifelse( angle < -90, 1, 0)
 
# flip angle BY to make them readable
label_data$angle<-ifelse(angle < -90, angle+180, angle)
# ----- ------------------------------------------- ---- #

 

theme_set(theme_classic())

# Histogram on a Categorical variable
g <- ggplot(data, aes(Industry)) + ylim(-40,120) + coord_polar()
g + geom_bar(aes(fill=Address.Borough), width = 0.5) + 

  # Add the labels, using the label_data dataframe that we have created before
  geom_text(data=label_data, 
            aes(x=id, y=value+10, label=individual, hjust=hjust), 
            color="black", fontface="bold",alpha=0.6, size=2.5, angle= label_data$angle, inherit.aes = FALSE ) +
  
 theme(
    axis.text = element_blank(),
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    panel.grid = element_blank()
  )
